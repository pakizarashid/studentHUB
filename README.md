🔍 Project Overview:
StudentHub merges multiple university services, allowing students to access in-app messages from teachers, manage notes, receive university notifications, and more—all from one place. The app includes features like location services, helplines, student ID cards, class and teacher contact lists, attendance monitoring, academic scores, timetables, fee tracking, and more. It's designed to cater to authentic users with secure login options, while general information remains accessible to everyone.

💻 Technologies Used:
-React Native
-JavaScript
React Native Paper
Node.js
Firebase

✨ Key Features:
In-app messaging
Notes view and upload
Comprehensive academic resource management

💡 Challenges Overcome:
As this was my first full-stack app, time management was a significant challenge. I underestimated the complexity, but with dedication, I completed the project in just 3 months. I also faced hurdles with database connectivity, but persistence paid off, and I successfully navigated through these issues.

🏆 Achievements:
Through this project, I learned the importance of time management and discovered that I can independently deliver 75% of a project’s output without external help. This experience has boosted my confidence in tackling new technologies.

🚀 Looking Ahead:
I envision enhancing this app further by making it more secure and integrating AI features. Your feedback or suggestions for collaboration are most welcome! 🤝

## 🧠 Motivation behind Developing this Application

As an engineering student I have personally experienced the tension every student have before night of the exam. Students 👨‍💻 will be involved in gathering all the documents starting from PPTs to PDFs, etc. related to Course. Most of the times, all the notes are scattered it gets difficult to collect them. This app helps to solve the problem which helps them to keep all the notes at **one place** and ables every student to access it hassle-free.


## 🧐 Why Stumate?

We do have alternatives like Google Drive, WhatsApp, etc. but Stumate has some unique features that the other platforms which may or not provide. Stumate provide every services for free and will not charge anything from the student. Currently it is developed for GMR Institute of Technology, based on the requests and the demand we will be enhancing it.
