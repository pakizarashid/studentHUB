## 🧠 Motivation behind Developing this Application
As a computer student, I have personally experienced the tension every student has before the night of the exam. Students  will be involved in gathering all the notes, and documents starting from PPTs to PDFs, etc. related to the Course. This app helps to solve the problem which helps them to keep all the notes in **one place** and allows every student to access it hassle-free.
Secondly, there is an issue that teachers and administration use different platforms for communication and most of us get fake news and information. This app also helps to solve the problem which helps them to keep all the messages/notifications/alerts in **one place** and allows every student to access authentic information.
<br/><br/>

## 🔍 Why this Project:
We do have alternatives like Google Drive, WhatsApp, Gmail, university website, etc but StudentHub merges multiple mobile services, allowing students to access in-app messages from teachers, manage notes, receive university notifications, and more—all from one place. The app includes features like location services, helplines, student ID cards, class and teacher contact lists, attendance monitoring, academic scores, timetables, fee tracking, and more. It's designed to cater to authentic users with secure login options, while general information remains accessible to everyone.
