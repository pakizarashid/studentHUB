# 🚀 Project Showcase: StudentHub - Your University App! 📱

I’m excited to share my final year project, StudentHub - Your University App!, a mobile application designed to streamline the university experience by bringing all essential resources into one platform. 🎓

🔍 Project Overview:
StudentHub merges multiple university services, allowing students to access in-app messages from teachers, manage notes, receive university notifications, and more—all from one place. The app includes features like location services, helplines, student ID cards, class and teacher contact lists, attendance monitoring, academic scores, timetables, fee tracking, and more. It's designed to cater to authentic users with secure login options, while general information remains accessible to everyone.

💻 Technologies Used:

React Native
JavaScript
React Native Paper
Node.js
Firebase
✨ Key Features:

In-app messaging
Notes view and upload
Comprehensive academic resource management
💡 Challenges Overcome:
As this was my first full-stack app, time management was a significant challenge. I underestimated the complexity, but with dedication, I completed the project in just 3 months. I also faced hurdles with database connectivity, but persistence paid off, and I successfully navigated through these issues.

🏆 Achievements:
Through this project, I learned the importance of time management and discovered that I can independently deliver 75% of a project’s output without external help. This experience has boosted my confidence in tackling new technologies.

🚀 Looking Ahead:
I envision enhancing this app further by making it more secure and integrating AI features. Your feedback or suggestions for collaboration are most welcome! 🤝
